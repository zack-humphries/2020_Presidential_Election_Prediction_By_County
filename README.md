# 2020_County_Election_Prediction
A personal project that uses demographic and previous historic voting data to predict which party a county vote for during the 2020 presidential election

Uses 2016 voting margin, race, age, religion, income, education, county size, percent absentee, and total number of votes to predict which party each county will vote for.

Implements advanced multiple regression, random forest, and articifial neural network models.

As expected, the artificial neural network was more precice (~98%), whoever, random forest came very close (~97%).

Shows that the percent of absentee ballots of total votes do not factor greatly to which party a county will vote for.
